<h6 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-opacity">Do what?</h6>
<p class="center">"<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">A</span></b> software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of the software that make computers or other devices containing software work.”

<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">I</span></b>f you are like me and want to change the world then software development engineering can be your ticket.
</p>

<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">U</span></b>nless you have lived in a cave for the past few years, you probably noticed how technology has taken over. No industry is immune.


<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>ransportation has been transformed by engineers. Consider how Lyft has impacted the cab industry; even the way we rent cars is changing thanks to Turo. 

The communications industry has been transformed because of apps like Skype and WhatsApp.

Big changes have happened to the hospitality and travel industry because of sites like Air BnB.

</p>

<p>
 Hospitals are using technology to enable patients to triage themselves upon arriving to speed up hospital wait times. 
</p>
  <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-opacity">So how does it help?</h6>

<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">A</span></b>utonomous vehicles could make our roads much safer because of technology.  Vehicles are steadily providing better safety features because of engineering.


<b><span class="special-text">S</span></b>ervices like Lfyt help to reduce our carbon footprint.


<b><span class="special-text">R</span></b>idesharing apps are helping to reduce the number of cars on the road. Carbon dioxide emissions are reduced as a result. 

<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">S</span></b>ocial apps allow people from all ends of the globe to connect and interact even if on a limited basis. Bridge building is important and is a way to positively change the world, and that can now be done virtually.  
</p>



<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>he way we consume entertainment is rapidly changing. We have apps that allow us to game with others around the globe. Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Extended Reality, and Mixed Reality are taking gaming to new heights. We are no longer dependent on the cable-TV for great entertainment. Apps like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and others have brought about dramatic change. 
</p>
<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>echnology and engineering have also impacted dating. The advent of social media meant no longer being constrained to date locally. Now people have the ability to date others from all over the globe and meet people they never would have otherwise.

  <h6 class="w3-wide w3-center w3-opacity">Big Data and The Internet of Things</h6>

<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>he Internet Of Things is changing our lives and making everything smarter.  It allows us to design and build smarter homes, for example.  It is also impacting sports. Teams are using sensors on athletic equipment and on athletes that provide performance feedback. Even sports venues are impacted by the Internet Of Things. It is still a fairly new paradigm, but the potential is enormous. 
</p>
<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>echnology is improving agriculture. It helps to grow more food with less water using farm sensors and farm management software. 
</p>
<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">E</span></b>ngineers are using algorithms, big data, and data analytics to change the world through artificial intelligence.
</p>

</p>

<p>
<b><span class="w3-xxlarge">T</span></b>echnology is very powerful, and with great power comes even greater responsibility. Software engineers have an ability to affect the world like no other. That is becoming more evident with each day passed. Much of our lives depend on technology; it is completely interwoven into most aspects of our lives. The examples above are only the tip of the iceberg, and it will only increase with time. The world is changing, and software and engineers are at the forefront!
