Apps like Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV and others have brought about dramatic change. </p>

<p><span class="center"><img src="/img/post_images/dating-app.jpeg" alt="Dating Apps" /></span></p>

<p><b><span class="special-text">T</span></b>echnology and engineering have also impacted dating. The advent of social media meant no longer being constrained to date locally. Now people have the ability to date others from all over the globe and meet people they never would have otherwise. </p>

<p><b><span class="center wide">Big Data and The Internet of Things</span>
<span class="center"><img src="/img/post_images/iot2.png" alt="IOT" /></span></b></p>

<p><b><span class="special-text">T</span></b>he Internet Of Things is changing our lives and making everything smarter.  It allows us to design and build smarter homes, for example.  It is also impacting sports. Teams are using sensors on athletic equipment and on athletes that provide performance feedback. Even sports venues are impacted by the Internet Of Things. It is still a fairly new paradigm, but the potential is enormous. </p>

<p><span class="center"><img src="/img/post_images/fms-image.jpeg" alt="Farm Management" /></span></p>

<p><b><span class="special-text">T</span></b>echnology is improving agriculture. It helps to grow more food with less water using farm sensors and farm management software. </p>

<p><b><span class="special-text">E</span></b>ngineers are using algorithms, big data, and data analytics to change the world through artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><span class="center"><img src="/img/post_images/ai.jpeg" alt="AI Image" /></span></p>

<p><b><span class="special-text">T</span></b>echnology is very powerful, and with great power comes even greater responsibility. Software engineers have an ability to affect the world like no other. That is becoming more evident with each day passed. Much of our lives depend on technology; it is completely interwoven into most aspects of our lives. The examples above are only the tip of the iceberg, and it will only increase with time. The world is changing, and software and engineers are at the forefront!</p>
